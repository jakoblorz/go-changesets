# Changeset Groups and Relationships

A changeset group is simply the set of changesets introduced in the same git commit. Grouping is for coordination, not dependency solving.

## Why it matters

If one feature spans multiple projects, you usually want to review and release those projects together. Groups make that coupling visible.

## How groups are created

Create related changesets in a single commit (recommended), or squash-merge the feature PR so the changesets land in one commit on main.

```bash
changeset add
# select auth, api, shared
git add .changeset/
git commit -m "feat: add OAuth2"
```

## Viewing groups

```bash
changeset tree --filter open-changesets
```

The tree groups changesets by commit and shows which projects should be coordinated.

## Notes

- Grouping is automatic and based on git history.
- It does not enforce merge order; it only surfaces relationships.
