# Snapshot Releases (Release Candidates)

Snapshots create release candidate (RC) tags and GitHub pre-releases without modifying `version.txt`, `package.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`, or `.changeset/` files. They are meant for canary or pre-release testing.

## What it does

- Calculates the next version from pending changesets (in memory).
- Finds the next `-rcN` tag for the current branch.
- Creates a git tag and optional GitHub pre-release.

## Tag format

- Go: `project@v1.2.3-rc0`
- Node: `project@1.2.3-rc0`

## Commands

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=...

# One project
changeset snapshot --project auth --owner org --repo repo

# All projects with changesets
changeset each --filter open-changesets -- \
  changeset snapshot --owner org --repo repo
```

## Branch awareness

Snapshot tags are discovered using git ancestry (`--merged HEAD`), so different branches can have different RC sequences without conflict.

## Next steps

- Automation examples: [GitHub Integration](./github-integration.mdx)
- Full workflow example: `kitchensink/.github/workflows/snapshot.yml`
