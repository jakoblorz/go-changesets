# Concepts and Project Model

This page describes the key concepts used by `go-changeset` so you can reason about what the CLI does and how to integrate it into your repo.

## Workspace detection

`go-changeset` walks up from the current directory and stops at the first directory that contains a `go.work` or a `package.json`.

- If it finds a `go.work`, it treats the repo as a Go workspace and loads projects from `use` entries.
- If it finds a `package.json`, it loads Node projects from workspaces (or the root package if it is not private).
- If both exist in the same root, it loads both Go and Node projects.
- Unless `--node-strict-workspace` is enabled, Node discovery also scans for `package.json` files while honoring `.gitignore`.

## Projects

A project is the unit of versioning and releasing.

- **Go projects**: discovered by `go.work` `use` entries and `go.mod` files.
- **Node projects**: discovered via `package.json` workspaces (and optional fuzzy scan).

Each project has a name, a root path, and a manifest (`go.mod` or `package.json`).

## Changesets

A changeset is a Markdown file in `.changeset/` with YAML frontmatter.

```md
---
auth: minor
---

Add OAuth2 support
```

When you select multiple projects, `changeset add` creates one file per project in the same commit.

## Version sources

- **Go**: `version.txt` at the project root.
- **Node**: the `version` field in `package.json`.

## Disabling projects

- **Go**: set `version.txt` to `false` to hide the project.
- **Node**: set `private: true` in `package.json` to hide the project.

## Tags

Published versions are represented by git tags:

- Go final: `project@v1.2.3`
- Go RC: `project@v1.2.3-rc0`
- Node final: `project@1.2.3`
- Node RC: `project@1.2.3-rc0`

## Changelogs and templates

`go-changeset` generates per-project `CHANGELOG.md` files. You can customize formatting with `.changeset/changelog.tmpl`.
