# Introduction to Using Changesets

go-changeset makes release intent explicit in Go workspaces and Node workspaces. A changeset is a small Markdown file in `.changeset/` that records which project changed, the bump type (patch/minor/major), and a human message for the changelog.

```md
---
auth: minor
---

Add OAuth2 support
```

## The workflow (short version)

1. Add changesets with your code changes.
2. Version a project to update its version and changelog.
3. Publish when you are ready to create tags and releases.

```bash
# 1) Add changesets (interactive)
changeset add

# 2) Version a project
changeset version --project auth

# 3) Publish a release (tag + GitHub release)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=...
changeset publish --project auth --owner org --repo repo
```

For CI fan-out, use `changeset each` with filters (see the CLI reference).

## What versioning does

Running `changeset version` for a project:

- bumps the version (`version.txt` for Go, `package.json` for Node)
- appends a new entry to `CHANGELOG.md`
- deletes the consumed changeset files for that project

## Source of truth

- The version file in the repo represents the next release (staged on branches and PRs).
- Git tags represent published releases on the default branch.

## Differences from JS changesets (quick)

- Go projects use `version.txt`; Node projects use `package.json`.
- Tags are per project: Go uses `project@v1.2.3`, Node uses `project@1.2.3`.
- Selecting multiple projects in `changeset add` creates one changeset file per project.
- Related changesets are defined by the commit that introduced them and shown in `changeset tree`.
