# GitHub Actions Integration

go-changeset keeps CI low-tech and repo-specific. It provides stable primitives for versioning and publishing; you decide how to wire them into workflows.

## Release model (two-phase)

1. **Version PRs (staging)**
   - Read changesets and bump versions.
   - Update `version.txt` (Go) or `package.json` (Node).
   - Append to `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. **Publish (after merge)**
   - Compare version file to latest tag.
   - Create a tag and (optionally) a GitHub release.

## Minimal workflow outline

Use `changeset each` to fan out per project (or run `changeset version` once to version everything together).

```bash
# Create version updates (per project)
changeset each --filter open-changesets -- changeset version

# Publish when version file > latest tag
export GITHUB_TOKEN=...
changeset each --filter outdated-versions -- \
  changeset publish --owner org --repo repo
```

## Optional helpers

- `changeset tree` groups changesets by commit to coordinate multi-project releases.
- `changeset gh pr open/link/close` can create and update release PRs.

## Tokens

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` is required for `publish` and `snapshot` when creating GitHub releases.
- `GH_TOKEN` (or `GITHUB_TOKEN`) is required for `changeset gh pr` commands.
