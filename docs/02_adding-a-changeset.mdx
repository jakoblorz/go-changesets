# Adding a Changeset

Add a changeset alongside code changes so release intent is captured early and reviewable.

## Create one

From the repo root:

```bash
changeset add
# or simply
changeset
```

You will:
1. Select the affected projects.
2. Choose a bump type (patch/minor/major).
3. Write a short message that will appear in the changelog.

## Bump types (quick guide)

- patch: bug fixes, internal refactors, docs
- minor: new backwards-compatible features
- major: breaking changes

If you are pre-1.0, the same rules apply.

## What gets created

One file per selected project in `.changeset/`, all created in the same commit when you commit them.

```md
---
auth: minor
---

Add OAuth2 support
```

Selecting multiple projects creates multiple files with the same message.

## Edit later

Changesets are plain Markdown. You can edit the frontmatter bump type and the message before running `changeset version`.

## When to skip

Skip changesets for changes that do not affect users: docs-only, tests-only, CI/build scripts, or formatting-only changes.
